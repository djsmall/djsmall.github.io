                It's disappointing that we won't be getting together this Christmas, especially since it marks a year
                since we all got to see one another. It's obviously been a hard year, but thankfully it seems like 2021
                will bring some relief.</p>
            <p>Thank you for the presents. I couldn't afford to do any Christmas shopping this year, but I did have a
                little time after school finals to throw together this e-card. I hope we can all enjoy this season in
                our own way, and hope this card makes things a little more fun.
            </p>
